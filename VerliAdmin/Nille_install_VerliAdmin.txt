This guide is for installing verliadmin on slackware.
It might work with other distrobutions as well but path and dir and commands 
may differ.

You need to have apache or apache2 with php installed. (if you made 
fullinstall of slackware the you already got them).

Download VerliAdmin
unzip VerliAdmin    with unzip VerliAdmin_0.3_RC3.zip    remember to change 
to version if you use another version.
cd VerliAdmin

Now edit config.php thats located in Verliadmin folder.
In config.php change the mysqlsettings.
You will find something like this.

//      MySQL server configuration:
$mysql_host = "localhost";                      //MySQL host (usualy 
localhost)
$mysql_user = "verlihub";                              //MySQL username
$mysql_password = "verlihub";                            //MySQL password
$mysql_database = "verlihub";          //MySQL database name

In this section you insert your dbconfig settings. (you can se them in your 
config directory for me it's cat /root/.verlihub/dbconfig).

Now copy VerliAdmin folder to /var/www/htdocs

Type vh_getdb (logs you into mysql useing verlihubs default db, but it only 
works on newer verlihubs)
Type \. /var/www/htdocs/VerliAdmin/setuplist.sql
That imports VerliAdmins settings to db.

Type \. /var/www/htdocs/VerliAdmin/setuphelp.sql
This didn't work for me i got only an error messige saying that setuphelp 
table didn't exist.
If you get an error message then copy and paste this into mysql.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `setuphelp` (
`var` VARCHAR( 32 ) NOT NULL ,
`vtype` ENUM( 'string', 'int', 'float', 'boolean', 'class', 'text' ) NOT 
NULL ,
`help` TEXT,
`applies` ENUM( 'not', 'new', 'now' ) NOT NULL ,
PRIMARY KEY ( `var` ) );

Then press enter.
Now try \. /var/www/htdocs/VerliAdmin/setuphelp.sql
Now it should work
why it didn't work for me must be an small bugg, but it might have been 
fixed when you try this.

Now we need to see that it imported it ok.
Type  show tables;

+---------------------+
| Tables_in_verlihub  |
+---------------------+
| SetupList           |
| banlist             |
| file_trigger        |
| kicklist            |
| reglist             |
| setuphelp           |
| temp_rights         |
| unbanlist           |
+---------------------+

If you see setuphelp here it should be imported ok.

Now let's look at SetupList
Type  select * from SetupList where file= "VerliAdmin";
If you see alot of things now it imported setuplist.sql ok.

type \q
You have now saved and quit mysql.

Now edit your apace config pico /etc/apache/httpd.conf or pico 
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
(the reason why i type two lines here is because there is two apache servers 
apache and apache2)

Make shore that this line at the end of the configfile is  uncomented(no # 
or ; before the line),
Include /etc/apache/mod_php.conf or Include /etc/apache2/mod_php.conf

scroll up in the file and find a line like this DirectoryIndex index.html 
then edit the line to this
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

Quit and save the config.

Then edit php.ini
Go to the section Dynamic Extensions in php.ini
There we look for a line like this
extension=mysql.so  and make shore it's  uncomented(no # or ; before the 
line)
in PHP4 i think it's uncommented by default but not in PHP5
Now start apache with command  httpd
If it's already running restart it  with apachectl graceful
Now log in to your verliadmin thrue an webbrowser.
Http://myadress.com/VerliAdmin/    Http://your_ip_or_adress/VerliAdmin/

I hope you enjoy VerliAdmin.
